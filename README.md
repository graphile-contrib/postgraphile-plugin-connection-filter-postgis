- `@graphile/postgis@0.1.0`
- `postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter@^2.0.0`

## Development

To establish a test environment, create an empty PostgreSQL database and set a `TEST_DATABASE_URL` environment variable with your database connection string.

```bash
createdb graphile_test
export TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/graphile_test
yarn
yarn test
```
